#1. Import the NUMPY package under the name np.

import numpy as np


#2. Print the NUMPY version and the configuration.

print(np.version.version)


#3. Generate a 2x3x5 3-dimensional array with random values. 
#Assign the array to variable "a"
#Challenge: there are at least three easy ways that use numpy to generate random arrays.
#How many ways can you find?


#First method

a = np.random.random((2,3,5))

#Second method

a=np.random.rand(2,3,5)

##Third Method

a=np.random.randint(0,100,(2,3,5))



#4. Print a.

print(a)



#5. Create a 5x2x3 3-dimensional array with all values equaling 1.
#Assign the array to variable "b"

b=np.ones((5,2,3))



#6. Print b.

print(b)



#7. Do a and b have the same size? How do you prove that in Python code?

if a.size == b.size:
    print("a and b have the same size: " + str(a.size))
else:
    print("a and b have different sizes; a is %s and b is %s" %(a.size,b.size))



#8. Are you able to add a and b? Why or why not?

np.add(a,b)

#The method will not work with arrays of different shapes
#This is because mathematically two matrices of different sizes is not defined, it can't be done



#9. Transpose b so that it has the same structure of a (i.e. become a 2x3x5 array). Assign the transposed array to varialbe "c".
c=np.transpose(b, (1,2,0))



#10. Try to add a and c. Now it should work. Assign the sum to varialbe "d". But why does it work now?

d=np.add(a,c)

#it now works because the shape of the two arrays are equal an therefore the mathematical operation is doable



#11. Print a and d. Notice the difference and relation of the two array in terms of the values? Explain.

print(a)
print(d)

# In mathematical terms, addign two matrices means adding the value of each position with the value on the same position of the second matrix.
# All values in d are one unit higher than units in a because all values in matrix c were ones.



#12. Multiply a and c. Assign the result to e.

e=np.multiply(a,c)
print(a.shape)
print(c.shape)
print(e)



#13. Does e equal to a? Why or why not?

list1=[]
list2=[]

for x in e:
    for y in x:
        for z in y:
            list1.append(z)
                   
for i in a:
    for j in i:
        for k in j:
            list2.append(k)

            
if list1==list2:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
    
# e is equal to a because the command multiply  in numpy is the multiplication of each index with the corresponding in index in the other matrix
# Eijk*1=Eijk



#14. Identify the max, min, and mean values in d. Assign those values to variables "d_max", "d_min", and "d_mean"

d_max=d.max()
d_min=d.min()
d_mean=d.mean()




#15. Now we want to label the values in d. First create an empty array "f" with the same shape (i.e. 2x3x5) as d using `np.empty`.

f=np.empty(d.shape)
print(f.shape)
print(f)



"""
#16. Populate the values in f. 
For each value in d, if it's larger than d_min but smaller than d_mean, assign 25
to the corresponding value in f.
If a value in d is larger than d_mean but smaller than d_max, assign 75 to the corresponding value in f.
If a value equals to d_mean, assign 50 to the corresponding value in f.
Assign 0 to the corresponding value(s) in f for d_min in d.
Assign 100 to the corresponding value(s) in f for d_max in d.
In the end, f should have only the following values: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100.
Note: you don't have to use Numpy in this question.
